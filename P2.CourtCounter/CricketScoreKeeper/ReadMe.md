Implement an app to track scores between two teams within a basketball game.

This is the second project in the Android Basics Nanodegree by Udacity. The Application uses basic concepts of java programming and functions as well as Android Viewgroups

### Things Learnt

To develop the Application, we used the following fundamentals of Java Programming and Android User-Interaction

* Java Programming Fundamentals
  * Data Types such as Integers
  * Arithmatic Operations
  * Functions in Java
* Dynamic Application design
* Performing tasks based on User's Actions
* Nested View Groups
* Scroll Views
* Layouts
  * Relative Layouts
  * Linear Layouts
* Buttons
* TextViews
* Units in Android

### Rubric

#### Layout

Criteria | Task
------------ | -------------
Game Choosen | The Choosen Game has either multiple amounts of points that can be scored, as in American Football, or multiple important metrics to track, such as fouls, outs and innings in baseball
Overall Layout | App is divided into two columns, one for each team
Column contents | Each column contains a large textview to keep track of the current score for that team  & Optionally add a second TextView to track another Important metric such as fouls
Score Buttons | Each Column contains multiple buttons. The buttons must track either:
| Each track a different kind of scoring
| Or
| Each track a different metric
